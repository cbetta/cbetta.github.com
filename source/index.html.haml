  I'm a Developer Relations consultant - if you want to know what that is have a look at my previous work to get an idea. I've worked at PayPal as a senior developer advocate and I run events with my friends at Geeks of London. I'm married to the amazing @mseckington and the owner of some very odd cats.

  I am passionate about Developer Experience, especially the initial
  onboarding of developers. I love to code in Ruby and Javascript.
  I appreciates web standards, continuous integration, distributed version
  control, test driven development, and the occasional good coffee.
