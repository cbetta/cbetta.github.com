  I'm a Developer Experience (DX) designer that helps to improve the onboarding,
  get started guides, and first use experiences of developer products. Why not book
  me for an audit of your developer experience?

  My previous jobs include a 3 year stint at PayPal as a senior developer
  advocate. I also run hackathons and unconferences with my friends at
  Geeks of London.

  I am passionate about Developer Experience, especially the initial
  onboarding of developers with little to no development experience. I'm also a
  developer that loves to code in Ruby and Javascript.
